# A Note From Russ, One Guy From CrafterCMS :)
This game is a birthday card to my childhood heroes. Roberta and Ken Williams, Scott Murphy, Mark Crowe (the two guys from Andromeda), Al Lowe, and many others who contributed to Sierra's adventure games.
I have no doubt that these games had a similar impact on many others. They taught us to solve problems, to laugh at ourselves, to get back up and keep trying when we failed, and to "Save early, Save often." For some like myself, they inspired us to get into programming.

Happy 40th to King's Quest!  

Much Love
-Russ

# Let them Eat Cake
Tomorrow Graham must meet with King Edwards for reasons unknown. This game takes place the night before.
Go on a silly quest in Graham's dreams and prepare for the adventure that lies ahead in the following days.
