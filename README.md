# A Note From Russ, One Guy From CrafterCMS :)
This game is a birthday card to my childhood heroes. Roberta and Ken Williams, Scott Murphy, Mark Crowe (the two guys from Andromeda), Al Lowe, and many others who contributed to Sierra's adventure games.
I have no doubt that these games had a similar impact on many others. They taught us to solve problems, to laugh at ourselves, to get back up and keep trying when we failed, and to "Save early, Save often." For some like myself, they inspired us to get into programming.

Happy 40th to King's Quest!  

Much Love
-Russ

# Source Code
The game is free. I wrote the AGI scripts that 'power' the game. I borrowed, modified, and mashed up graphics and sounds.

The source files are text and JSON files that can be edited by any tool. I've built plugins for CrafterCMS to edit graphic files and build the game.
The interpreter was initially written 8+ years ago by r1sc in TypeScript (GPL license) https://github.com/r1sc/agi.js. It was able to decode game graphic files and handle picture rendering, view rendering, and state machine mechanics. I've added to it to handle input and dialogues, inventory, sounds, saving games, etc. I've also fixed bugs when I've had to. I was so excited to find someone had started this project. It seemed abandoned so I picked it up. <3  

The game source, the tools I've created and the engine are all open source. Download it. Extend it. Make it better and contribute back.
