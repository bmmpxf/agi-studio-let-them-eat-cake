# A Note From Russ, One Guy From CrafterCMS :)
This game is a birthday card to my childhood heroes. Roberta and Ken Williams, Scott Murphy, Mark Crowe (the two guys from Andromeda), Al Lowe and the many others that contrinuted to Sierra's adventure games.
I have no doubt that these games had a similar impact on many others. They tought us to solve problems, to laugh at ourselves, to get back up and keep trying when we failed and to "Save early, Save often." For some like myself, they inspired us to get into programming.
Happy 40th to King' Quest!  

Much Love

# Let them Eat Cake
Tomorrow Graham must meet with King Edwards for reasons unkown. This game takes place the night before.
Go on a silly quest in Grahams dreams and prepare for the adventure that lays ahead in the following days.
